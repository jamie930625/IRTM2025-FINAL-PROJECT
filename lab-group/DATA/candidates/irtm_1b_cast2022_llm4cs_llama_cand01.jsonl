A homemade body scrub helps moisturize and exfoliate the skin, and with cold weather approaching it will make a killer gift this winter. It is simple to make and you can experiment with different sugars, Epsom salt, a variety of carrier oils, and essential oils. Feel free to get creative and fancy when making these scrubs; here is the basic recipe you can use to make a few batches. You\u2019ll need 2 cups Epsom salts or sugar (use organic cane sugar, brown sugar, or regular granulated), 1 cup carrier oil (grapeseed, olive, sweet almond, sesame, and safflower are all good), and 8-10 drops of your favourite essential oil. First, add Epsom salts or sugar to a bowl and slowly begin stirring in the oil until the mixture is smooth, but not goopy (You may not need the full cup of oil). Then, add essential oil and any other fun additions and mix well. Spoon into a decorative container or glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. You should choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub. The oil will separate in some of these scrubs, so it\u2019s a good idea to attach a small spoon if giving away as a gift."], "current_query": "Cool.

Show Respect: Do not forget \u2013 your teenager is not a child anymore and is a near-adult, and as such, deserves respect just like any other adult. When you address your teenager, always show respect. Do not let disdain or contempt show in your tone! Always treat their problems and fears with importance. Never shun off your teenager\u2019s fears as a childhood worry. 2. Praise Often: You must praise your teenager often. Be generous with your compliments. When you praise your teenager for something good they did, it boosts their confidence in heaps and bounds. It encourages them to do even better next time.

It is typical for Argentines and Uruguayans to have once or merienda around 5 pm, between the midday meal and supper.

In Infinity War, Rogers had spent two years as a fugitive, and the heroes who joined King T'Challa's army defending Wakanda couldn't be really considered a true Avengers team. But in Endgame, Captain America had the authority to make the call and by declaring every hero standing with him an Avenger, he unified the gigantic fighting force to the singular cause of beating Thanos once and for all. Cap making everyone fighting Thanos an Avenger in Endgame is a spiritual successor to Clint Barton's speech to Wanda Maximoff at the Battle of Sokovia in Age of Ultron. Terrified for her life, Hawkeye motivated Scarlet Witch to find her courage and fight, telling her, \"If you walk out that door, you are an Avenger.\" In Endgame, everyone who walked through a magic portal and joined the superheroes who travelled through time to resurrect them was an Avenger by Captain America's decree.

These algorithms can then have negative biases against women of color and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to \"racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining.\" The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color.", "But how does that happen?", "For example,  Author of the book \u201calgorithms of oppression\u201d, Safiya U. Noble was looking for websites to share with her stepdaughter and nieces. She searched \"black girls\" on Google, expecting to be directed to educational sites, historical information, or pop culture sites for young people. Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com. The first page was filled with similar results. According to Google in 2010, \"black girls\" were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations. They were defined as porn. What accounts for such racist, sexist search results? Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for \"black girls\" because those are the sites that people click on most.", "Are algorithms really biased against people of colour?", "When you use a search engine, relevant results are extracted from the index and ranked using an algorithm. Algorithms may seem like \u201cobjectively\u201d mathematic processes, but this is far from the truth. Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes. Let\u2019s take a deeper look. The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons. By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted. The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms. \u200b \u200b Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased. An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases. For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image. That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.\u200b \u200b Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context. By training an algorithm on that dataset, it learned to automatically filter out any \u201cblack-sounding\u201d names. The algorithm selected candidates on purely subjective criteria, perpetuating racial discrimination. This same form of automated discrimination prevents people of color from getting access to employment, housing, even student loans. Automation means we will create blind spots and racist biases in our so-called objective algorithms."], "current_query": "In terms of their ranking though, how does it work?", "predicted_rewrite": ["How do search engines rank results in terms of bias?"], "predicted_response": [""]}
