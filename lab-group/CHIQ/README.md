# CHIQ-AD: Candidate Generation

This component is designed for candidate generation using the CHIQ-AD method, as described in the original CHIQ paper. It focuses on generating rewritten queries for conversational search tasks.

## Innovations

Our approach differs from the original CHIQ-AD method by removing the History Summarization (HS) step. Based on our experiments, this modification leads to better and more stable performance. The removal of HS avoids the loss of contextual information, which is crucial for generating high-quality rewrites.

## Usage

The script `run_chiq.sh` is provided to execute the candidate generation process. Follow these steps to use it:

1. **Configure Parameters**:
   - `N_candidates`: Specify the number of candidates to generate.
   - `input_path`: Specify the path to the input data file. Ensure the file format matches the provided examples.
   - `output_path`: Specify the path to save the generated candidates.

2. **Run the Script**: After updating the script and preparing the required data, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    bash run_chiq.sh
    ```
