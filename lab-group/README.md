# IRTM2025-FINAL-RAGify (lab-group)

This repository contains the lab-group implementation for our IRTM 2025 Final Project.

It provides an end-to-end experimental pipeline for conversational search, focusing on advanced retrieval strategies and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Repository Structure

- `DATA/`: Contains datasets for data preparation, and instructions to get collections.
- `CHIQ/`: Implements the CHIQ-AD method for candidate generation.
- `LLM4CS/`: Implements the LLM4CS method for candidate generation.
- `IR_EXP/`: Handles passage retrieval and evaluation.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Preparation (`DATA/`)**:
   - Prepare datasets, including test topics, qrel files, and instructions to get collections.

2. **Rewrite Candidate Generation (`CHIQ/` & `LLM4CS/`)**:
   - Generate rewritten queries using CHIQ-AD and LLM4CS methods separately.

3. **Retrieve Passage (`IR_EXP/`)**:
   - Use different methods to retrieve passages for the final queries generated by CHIQ-AD and LLM4CS.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` to execute specific tasks.
